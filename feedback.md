Excellent work ! IronVolunteering is an ambitious project that aims to connect volunteers globally through a comprehensive web-based platform. 
While the project's scope is very coherent to the hackathon's instructions, the evaluation focuses on its alignment with class-taught concepts and the clarity of its implementation so your project can't be evaluated with streamlit...

- Coding Practices (18/20): The project indicates complex coding practices; however, a more detailed review is necessary to fully assess its adherence to clean code principles. Consistent documentation across all components would enhance readability.
- Algorithmic Implementation (17/20): The functionalities shows the use of sophisticated algorithms, especially in handling geographic data and user interactions. Refining these algorithms based on class teachings could strengthen the project.
- Database Handling (18/20): The project involves advanced database operations. Adopting partitioned indexing and materialized views for large datasets can notably increase query performance and scalability.
- API Integration (17/20): The integration with mapping services and other APIs shows a strong application of external resources. Detailed documentation on API usage and error handling would be beneficial.
- Software Development Principles (17/20): The ambitious nature of the project reflects a solid understanding of software development principles. Implementing modular design and version control best practices could further improve its structure and maintainability.
